These are the steps I took to create this game.
1. Created new Directory called "Trivia_Game"

2. Create new Git Repository
  a. git status (Tells you the current status of the Git Repo)
  b. git init (This initializes a new git repository in the "Trivia_Game" directory)
  
3. Configuring Git
  Note: This will allow others to see who you are and who made changes in the Git repository
  Git Global Setup
  a. git config --global user.name "rthavixay23" 
  b. git config --global user.email "rthavixay@ucsd.edu" 
  c. git add . (Stage changes for commit note: Including the "." to add)
  d. git commit (This creates a snapshot and commits staged changes)
  
  
4. Pushing to an existing folder
  a. git push
